This repo is created for Hacktoberfest.

Welcome,
This is a collection of simple loading animations.

Use plain css and @keyframes to animate and design the loading animation.

Each page should contain only 8 animations.
If there is no more space on the latest page, Use page template to create a new page.
Also, dont forget to add it to pagination on index.html
Always add your loading animations at last.
they will be sorted automatically.
